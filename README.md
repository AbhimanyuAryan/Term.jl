### DOne
- [x] get plain text for Measure
  - [x] remove markup
  - [x] remove ansi
  
- [x] regex markup extraction
  - [x] deal with no or minmal closings
  - [x] test

- [x] color: test detection
  - [x] print all named colors
  - [x] test
  - [x] hex -> rgb

- [x] markup -> ansi substitution, modular
  - [x] detect style
  - [x] inject style
    - [x] all colors
  - [ ] fix bug with nested tags
  
- [x] segment
  - [x] base
  - [x] from string + style
  - [x] from string + markup

- [x] tests
  - [x] check that Measure is correct for all types of segment, segments, renderable...
  - [x] also check results make sense when concatenating them

- [x] panel
  - [x] base features
  - [x] subtitle
  



## Roadmap
- [x] textbox (panel of given size with hidden edges + text inside)
  - [x] have textbox accept multiple lines of inputs as variable number of strings
- [x] vLine/hLine and spacer
- [ ] pad function + option to pad objects like AbstractPanel (if/when needed)
  - [ ] pad string
  - [ ] pad renderable
  - [ ] vpad/hpad
 
#### docs/examples
- [x] hstack/vstack for variable number of inputs too
- [ ] README generated by Term like Rich's
- [x] improved logo

#### small functions
- [ ] `tprint`
- [ ] macros for styling a string
- [x] box
- [x] panel
  - [x] panel subtitle (new make line method)
  - [ ] set height + vertical alignment

#### features
- [ ] titleline : hLine with title centered in the middle
- [ ] allow things like Panel and TextBox to `fill` their parent and `fit` their content.
- [ ] inspect
  - [ ] type/struct inspection
  - [ ] type hierarchy tree (https://towardsdatascience.com/runtime-introspection-julias-most-powerful-best-kept-secret-bf845e282367)
- [ ] error's traceback
- [ ] logging
- [ ] pretty print common data structures
  - [ ] highlight type info ::Type or <:Type

- [ ] latex->unicode parsing (https://github.com/phfaist/pylatexenc)
- [ ] markdown parsing
- [ ] code syntax highlighting

## BUGS
- [ ] nested tags, outer's color/bg not correctly restored
- [ ] style: if a tag is at the beginning of a multiline string, it should be repeated on each line?
- [x] panel: style's mode applies to title too.
- [ ] `textbox` a bit buggy, produces weird output occasionally
  - [ ] `textbox` should "clean" the text, lay it out, and then inject the style back in
  - [ ] when splitting a line the style should be carried over
- `Panel` can't handle renderables larger than given width
