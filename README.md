## known bugs
- [ ] multiple styles on same line, text in between not rendered correctly


#### fixed bugs
- [x] style: if a tag is at the beginning of a multiline string, it should be repeated on each line?
- [x] panel: style's mode applies to title too.
- [x] `textbox` a bit buggy, produces weird output occasionally
- `Panel` can't handle renderables larger than given width
- [x] When splitting markup text over multiple lines,  the wrong tag is carried over
- [x] nested tags, outer's color/bg not correctly restored
  - [x] mostly fixed though mode tags don't carry over correctly all the time
- [x] `highlight`, nested highlighting with hex code colors doesn't restore outer colors
